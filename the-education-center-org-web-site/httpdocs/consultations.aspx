<p style="font-size: 10pt;">When we meet with a child, we first build rapport and trust. We dispel any misconceptions they have about our services. Our staff clarifies that the Center is here to assist them in getting the required results to open the door to the future of their dreams.</p><br /><br />

<p style="font-size: 10pt;">We continue meeting with each student carefully listening to them. We never preach or interrogate. We remain an objective, caring third-party. The Center is a safe place where every participant can come to share their concerns, fears and dreams. The child's esteem is nurtured as we guide them successfully through challenges and equip them with the skills to cope with difficulties.</p>
