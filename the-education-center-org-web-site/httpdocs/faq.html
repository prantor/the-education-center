        I think it comes across in interactions with students, parents and in 
        the community. It's very satisfying work to sit down with a kid and help 
        them to realize that where they're at in life is not the end of the world, 
        and that there are a lot of great options and positive experiences waiting 
        for them if they make the effort for themselves. </font></p>

        kids' lives, and that's why we founded the Center.</font>

        a hand to make things better. We enroll children from all walks of life,

        weekends. We work with the young person's whole community - parents, teachers,

        see a great deal of negative behavior disappear. For many of them, school 
        has been a punitive experience. They're left asking, "Why can't I get 
        this? What's wrong with me?" and that leads to other problems. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our coaching and mentoring programs help kids see what's 
        been giving them a hard time in the first place; their problems belong 
        to them, but so do their solutions. We do this by providing diagnostic 
        testing to determine specific learning problems. We also provide preventative 
        alcohol and drug abuse counseling, academic tutoring and individual and 
        group counseling for kids and their families. </font> 
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also provide the opportunity for young people to be 
        mentored by a positive role model in the community to gain real world 
        experience. We've had CEOs showing kids what it takes to make it in business, 
        companies giving kids job training and a chance to advance, and meetings 
        with sports or entertainment personalities to hear how they got to where 
        they're at. Other times, mentoring kids has meant someone committing to 
        spending time with a kid, getting to know what they're all about and exposing 
        the kid to new things. We tailor-make programs that suit where kids are 
        coming from and where they want to go.</font>

        tell it like it is to them and to their children. I don't sit across from 
        kids and do the old clinical thing where I say 'what's your problem?' 
        Why would a young person listen to me if I say the same things as mom 
        and dad? We establish a relationship and trust. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our uniqueness comes in building trust and respect with 
        kids. Once they get here, they get to try things they may not normally 
        try, like doing homework and jobs. A lot of these young people are not 
        risk-takers. We get them to feel self-confident in school and in holding 
        down jobs. If you're feeling good about your yourself, you will get better 
        at life. </font>

        <img src="graphics/bluebar1.gif" width="450" height="1"></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mentors help young people see the real-world applications 
        of what they're learning in school, and gives them a sense of their purpose 
        and value in the world. This helps focus a kid's direction in school, 
        provides them with valuable job skills and contacts, as well as help get 
        kids feeling good about themselves through positive interactions.</font>

        does the Center find mentors?</font></b></font></font><br>
        <img src="graphics/bluebar1.gif" width="450" height="1"></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We utilize resources in the community. Anyone can help, 
        from business people to athletes and politicians. Anyone willing to take 
        the time to talk to children can be trained to be a mentor. Many professionals 
        I've met with over the years had to overcome great adversity to arrive 
        at success. These people don't lecture kids, but they show them by example. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We're always looking for new mentors for kids, from all 
        levels of society with all different types of backgrounds and experiences. 
        Just as kids are all uniquely valuable and talented so too are all mentors. 
        The Center provides training and orientation to make sure a good match 
        is created, and monitors mentorship participants closely. Working together, 
        mentoring is mutually rewarding!</font>

        kids different today?</font></b></font></font><br>
        <img src="graphics/bluebar1.gif" width="450" height="1"></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Children and teens are forced to grow up faster today 
        then ever before. There's a far greater pressure on them to succeed and 
        far more serious obstacles for them to overcome. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Drug abuse is a major difference, but so too is the amount 
        of violence occurring in our society on a daily basis. Community, in many 
        places, is just a foreign concept. Young people too often become isolated 
        and fall prey to negative influences without anyone noticing the problem 
        until it's too late. </font> 
      <p><font size="+1" color="#006699"><font color="#3DA54F" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#006600" size="3"><a name="thirteen"></a>Why 
        are kids so drawn to violence?</font></b></font></font><br>
        <img src="graphics/bluebar1.gif" width="450" height="1"></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everybody wants to point the finger of blame, but quite 
        frankly, we live in a violent society. I'm talking about a society where 
        violence is almost an acceptable form of behavior. Young people emulate 
        that behavior. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kids need to feel included in society so they don't feel 
        excluded from the world around them and act out against it. By the time 
        a kid has been drawn into violent behavior many people have misunderstood 
        that kid and also missed the chance to create a positive influence in 
        his or her life. </font> 
      <p><font size="+1" color="#006699"><font color="#3DA54F" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#006600" size="3"><a name="fourteen"></a>What 
        signs indicate a kid is in trouble?</font></b></font></font><br>
        <img src="graphics/bluebar1.gif" width="450" height="1"></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parents, teachers and adults need to look and listen. 
        If you're doing all the talking to a young person you're missing the point 
        of what they're saying to you. Obviously, underachieving in school, getting 
        involved in drug and alcohol abuse or getting on the wrong side of the 
        law are big red flags. But so too are signs of low self-esteem and lack 
        of confidence; these are telltale signs of isolation and insecurity. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" color="#006699"><font color="#3DA54F" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#006600" size="3"><a name="fifteen"></a>How 
        do you advise parents to handle &quot;problem&quot; kids?</font></b></font></font><br>
        <img src="graphics/bluebar1.gif" width="450" height="1"></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Love your children for who they are. Spend time with them. 
        Be supportive and encouraging. Don't be too quick with judgment or advice. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parents need to love their own kids, but they also need 
        to love their kids' friends. They need to give guidance and support wherever 
        they can. Relationships to kids are as important as location is in real 
        estate. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" color="#006699"><font color="#3DA54F" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#006600" size="3"><a name="sixteen"></a>Is 
        The Education Center method applicable at home, in school?</font></b></font></font><br>
        <img src="graphics/bluebar1.gif" width="450" height="1"></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Center's approach is one-on-one listening and sharing 
        of advice. Above all, young people need a lot of support and attention, 
        from both parents and teachers. Our approach to each child is different. 
        Parents or teachers can't have just one set of rules or guidelines for 
        dealing with kids. They need to be flexible, open-minded and creative. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think parents need to turn off the television and get 
        involved in their children's lives. The remote control switch can't instill 
        values, confidence or educate; but parents can. School needs to feel more 
        like a place where students aren't just passing through for eight hours 
        a day. Kids should feel that school is the center of the community, and 
        that they can express themselves freely, and not get lost in the shuffle.

      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In more than twenty years, the Center has helped thousands

        <img src="graphics/bluebar1.gif" width="450" height="1"></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everyone has a responsibility. We do, the parents do and 
        so does the kid. If everyone works in a collaborative effort then we will 
        see results. It makes more sense to give young people the skills they 
        need now then to lock them up and pay $30,000 a year for their maintenance. 
        Every child can be successful in school and in life.</font></p>
