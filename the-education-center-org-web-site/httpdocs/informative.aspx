<h2 style="padding-left: 15px;">Parents Q/A for Poor Comprehension Skills</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; padding-right: 5px; padding-left: 5px; border-bottom: solid 1px #000000;border-top: solid 1px #000000;">

<strong>How do parents know their child is struggling with comprehension issues?</strong><br /><br />
Kids often hide the fact that they are struggling. They would often rather appear lazy, apathetic, or rebellious than admit that they are struggling to do something which may appear easy to others.
<br /><br />
Parents should ask their kids what they are reading about. Can he/she summarize the story? Can he/she empathize with characters in the story? Can he/she explain why an event in the story happened? Can he/she relate events in a story to real life?
<br /><br />

<strong>What can parents do to help with comprehension issues?</strong><br /><br />

Hold a conversation and discuss what your child has read. Ask your child probing questions about the book and connect the events to his or her own life. For example, say "I wonder why that girl did that?" or "How do you think he felt? Why?" and "So, what lesson can we learn here?".<br /><br />
Help your child make connections between what he or she reads and similar experiences he has felt, saw in a movie, or read in another book.<br /><br />
Help your child monitor his or her understanding. Teach her to continually ask herself whether she understands what she's reading.<br /><br />
Help your child go back to the text to support his or her answers.<br /><br />
Discuss the meanings of unknown words, both those he reads and those he hears.<br /><br />
Read material in short sections, making sure your child understands each step of the way.<br /><br />
Discuss what your child has learned from reading informational text such as a science or social studies book.

<strong>How can comprehension issues affect other parts of a kid’s life (self-esteem)?</strong><br /><br />
Reading comprehension is an essential skill throughout one’s entire education. If this issue is not addressed, school will only become exceedingly more difficult and frustrating. Though a kid might hide the fact that he is struggling with comprehension issues from all others, he/she will not be able to hide it from him/herself, which will invariable contribute to feelings of inadequacy.

<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; padding-right: 5px; padding-left: 5px; border-bottom: solid 1px #000000;">
<strong>Can these issues be overcome?</strong><br /><br />
Yes, of course. <br /><br />
But, it takes a lot of work and effort, and possibly some outside help. Reading is a skill, and like any skill it is acquired through lots of practice. We, as human beings, are all different and to each of us some skills are easier to learn and some are harder. For some, reading just takes more practice.<br /><br />
Parents should provide lots of assistance. If possible, special assistance from teachers will be beneficial. Assistance from tutors may also help. The more assistance a kid receives the better – provided that he/she is willing to work. <br /><br />
There are also many various learning tools that may help the process.

<strong>How can parents motivate kids with poor comprehension skills to work extra hard?</strong><br /><br />
Parents should be active in the whole process. Be engaged in what your child is reading; ask plenty of questions about what he/she is reading. Help your child figure out the answers. <br /><br />
Find reading material that your child will find interesting and stimulating. <br /><br />
Parents should be honest with their kids, and explain that they will have to work harder. They should explain why reading is such an important skill and is worth the extra time and work. They should also read more themselves to demonstrate its importance and their sincerity, as well as to inspire their kids.
