<b>Characteristics of Safe Schools</b></p>
<p>
Safe schools share similar characteristics.  They have strong academic focus, set high standards, provide clear expectations and support the achievements of students.  They believe all students can learn and behave appropriately while appreciating individual difference.
</p>
<p>
They also promote positive relationships.  This provides children with an adult to talk to about needs, fears, anxieties, dreams and goals.  Students need to spend quality time with adults, be encouraged to help each other and be made to feel comfortable in giving and receiving help.
</p>
<p>
These schools treat students with respect, as well as model and teach good character.  Promoting good citizenship, honesty, kindness and responsibility foster positive behavior.  Safety issues are discussed with students.  They are taught the dangers of firearms, appropriate ways to express anger, how to deal with feelings and conflict resolution.
</p>
<p>
Students are more likely to experience success, and less likely to be disruptive if their parents are involved in their education.  Schools must make parents feel included, keep them involved, and aid them in securing help when necessary (outside agencies and resources).  Local support services, law enforcement, religious organizations and children’s organizations can also be valuable resources.
</p>
<p>
A school’s physical environment may help create a safe environment.  If students are proud of their school, they have more respect for it and the people in it.  We must help empower students to be more involved in the issues that effect them.
</p>
<p>
There should be a school security plan in place.  Supervise building access and conduct building safety audits with school security or law enforcement.  Arrange for supervision during critical times (between classes, lunch) and keep adults visible in the building.  Encourage parent to visit.  Stagger dismissal times and lunch periods.  And make the physical condition of the building inviting, clean, and comfortable and in good repair (school pride!)
</p>
<p>
EARLY WARNING SIGNS
	Although it is not always possible to predict violent behavior, there are early warning signs that may indicate potentially violent situations.  It is important to remember that these signs do not necessarily indicate a problem or mean a child is prone to violence.  It’s alright to be concerned, but don’t overreact.
	</p>
<p>
Training is necessary so everyone can identify and respond to the early warning signs.  Stress that these signs are just an aid in identifying and reaching children who may need help.  Children’s emotions are triggered by many factors, and how they express them depends on their developmental level.  To prevent signs from being misinterpreted, stress that trouble is more likely to occur when children exhibit more than one sign repeatedly, with increasing intensity.
</p>
<p>
If children exhibit aggressive behavior early in life and are not given help or support, this behavior will continue.  Acting on warning signs can prevent future violent acts.  These warning signs include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Withdrawal
<li>Excessive feelings of rejection
<li>Being a victim of violence
<li>Drastic change in their interest in school and own achievement
<li>Feelings of being picked on
<li>Expression of violence in their work (watch for this occurring consistently over time, particularly if it’s directed to one individual)
<li>Uncontrollable anger, particularly over minor incidents
<li>History of discipline problems or aggressive behavior
<li>Prejudicial attitudes and intolerance of differences
<li>Drug/alcohol use
<li>Gang involvement
<li>Inappropriate access to, possession of, and use of firearms (it is important to include families when this is a concern to educate them on proper use and storage of firearms) and
<li>Threats of violence – any threat needs to be taken seriously.
</ul><p>
There are some signs which require immediate attention and response.  IF these imminent warning signs are observed, parents should be notified, and helped from the appropriate agency secured:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Serious physical fighting
<li>Severe destruction of property
<li>Severe rage for minor reasons
<li>Detailed threats of lethal violence
<li>Possession and/or use of weapons, and
<li>Self-injurious behavior or threats of suicide.
</ul><p>
Strategies and intervention can help ward off potential violence.  Again, it is vital that everyone take part in the plan and be aware of potential dangers and how to get help.  The following are some strategies for combating violence:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Train staff to identify warning signs
<li>Form a team of specialists to evaluate and address behavioral concerns
<li>Develop simple procedures for reporting observations and incidents and providing immediate help
<li>Help students see there are consequences for their actions
<li>Analyze where and when violence occurs
<li>Implement school-wide policies that support responsible behavior
<li>Provide a link between families and community agencies that are able to offer help, and
<li>Teach alternative responses such as problem solving and anger control.
Parent must parent!  They have to stay involved in their children’s lives.  You can’t phone it in or fax it in!  That kind of parenting won’t work!  Relationships to children are as important as location is to real estate.
</ul><p>

Dr. Litow founded The Education Center in Oak Park in 1979 to provide counseling services for young people ages 4 to 20 who could not afford standard fees.  A second Center was opened in Naperville in 1987.  Over the years, the staff has worked with thousands of young people and families on issues such as learning disabilities, physical and sexual abuse, drugs and gangs, unemployment, truancy and running away, homelessness and suicide.  Here, at-risk students receive the extra-special attention for their needs that is usually hard to come by in a school setting.  For more information on the Center call 630.420.7807.
