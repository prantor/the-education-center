We enroll any young person who is going through a rough patch in their lives and haven't found anyone who can listen, understand and is willing to make the commitment to believe in them and give them a hand to make things better. We enroll children from all walks of life, all ethnic and social backgrounds, from Chicago and the suburbs.
