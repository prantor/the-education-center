<p style="font-size: 10pt; color: #666666;">Founded in 1979, The Education Center of Developmental Resources was created as an Illinois not-for-profit organization to empower children who were dealing with a broad spectrum of problems. Thousands of children have been helped since then—from all social, cultural and economic backgrounds. No individual or family has ever been turned away for financial reasons. The Center is headquartered in Naperville, Illinois with services available throughout the Chicagoland area.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; color: #666666;">From its inception the Center has sought community involvement. Business and civic leaders have provided internships, mentoring and job opportunities. The sense of belonging that this engenders in a child goes far beyond traditional forms of counseling. Mentors have included the late Chicago Bears owner, George Halas; former Chicago Bear and broadcaster, Johnny Morris; former chief-of-staff for President Reagan, Sam Skinner; former U.S. Senator, Paul Simon; Illinois Secretary of State, Jesse White; newspaper columnist, Irv Kupcinet; and broadcasters, Joan Esposito and the late Tim Weigel.</p>
