<p style="width: 375px;">“I was having big problems in school. I wasn't on the right track to go anywhere. When I went to The Education Center, I felt that the staff genuinely cared. If I do something wrong, they don't make me feel bad. You just want them to trust you and you wouldn't even think of lying to them. I'm applying to college now and I know I'm going to do well.”<br /><br />-J. Gulesarian, Wheaton
<br /><br /><br />“I was heading downward, and you helped me get rid of most of my rage... I went to other counselors, but never did I get the same help... I feel that The Education Center had a big effect in my life.”<br /><br />B. Sparbanie, Naperville<br /><br /><br />“School was always difficult for me. From kindergarten on I had feelings of inadequacy, lacked self-confidence and above all I was frustrated. Dr. Litow and The Education Center listened to me about my troubles in school. I was not lectured or looked down upon. Listening was the key.”<br /><br /> K. Gauer, Westmont
