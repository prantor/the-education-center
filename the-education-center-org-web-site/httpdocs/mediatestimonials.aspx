<p style="width: 580px;">“A lot of people have given up on our kids. Thank goodness there are places like The Education Center and people like Dr. Litow, who counsel kids who are deemed troublemakers and underachievers. They have been at it for more than 20 years<br /><br />-Mary A. Mitchell, Columnist<br />Chicago Sun Times
<br /><br />“If you had met Jim when he was a freshman in high school, you probably would have dismissed him as a "problem" kid. In fact, Jim had problems with the law and at school. His grades were D's and F's. He informed his guidance counselor that when he came of legal age, he planned to drop out of school. His mother Kathy, a struggling single parent, had sent Jim to almost every counselor and social services agency in the area. Jim's life changed the day he walked into The Education Center, a nonprofit agency that helps students succeed in school and learn job skills through a unique Business Mentorship Program. Four years later, Jim is a high school senior getting B's and C's. He plans to go to college and says he owes his success to The Education Center.”<br /><br />-Emily Ruggiero, Editor<br />Opportunities, A Publication of the Naperville Area Chamber of Commerce
<br /><br /><br />“Stronger bonds and better communication between parents and children can help avoid violent tragedies such as the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., panelists told a packed house at Benedictine University in Lisle this week. 'The relationship between a parent and child is the most important thing a parent has, but you have to work at it,' said Michael Litow, founder of The Education Center, a counseling and mentoring service headquartered in Naperville and serving the greater Chicago area.<br /><br />-Britt Carson, Writer<br />Copley Publications
<br /><br />“The medical facility recommended that Annie enroll at The Education Center. Within months, there was a positive difference in Annie that has continued. 'I go to a huge high school, and we don't have one-on-one relationships with our teachers. So I didn't feel they were interested enough,' Annie says. 'At The Education Center, Dr. Litowand his staff are more caring. They don't give advice until you ask for it.’”<br /><br />-Candace Purdom, Writer<br />Chicago Tribune
