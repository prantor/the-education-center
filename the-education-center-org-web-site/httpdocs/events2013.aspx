<h2 style="background: #6c6c6c; color: white; padding: 6px; text-align: center;">The Education Center Announces Scholarships in Honor of Students and Supporters</h2>

	<p>While the spotlight at last month&acute;s Kids&acute; Best Friend Award benefit shone brightly on the three award winners &ndash; Kids&acute; Best Friend Dawn Newman, Business Partner Molex Incorporated, and Making a Difference award winner Kathryn Birkett &ndash; the evening also highlighted several scholarships that The Education Center currently offers, or will soon offer, to needy students.</p>

	<p>Opening The Education Center&acute;s annual fundraiser was Adelyn Muleya, a Naperville North High School grad and student at Ball State University. Adelyn is currently the recipient of the John Fitzgerald Scholarship, created by the young man&acute;s parents in his memory. A Naperville Central High School graduate, John died in 2010.</p>
	
    <p>John&acute;s mother, Sherri Fitzgerald, spoke eloquently about the importance of the scholarship to her family. &ldquo;When a young person dies before their time, they don&acute;t have the future that you hoped for them. We had planned to provide an education for John, and it seemed to us that our loss could provide an opportunity for a student who couldn&acute;t otherwise get a college education.&rdquo; She explained that, after John&acute;s death, people asked what they could do for the family. Establishing a scholarship in John&acute;s name quickly became a meaningful goal. She added, &ldquo;Our children struggled in school. The Education Center gave them the guidance and support they needed to succeed. To think we could provide some scholarship money to students who struggle and try so hard to get an education is comforting. It&acute;s nice to offer a hand.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Attendees were also moved when Norma Hnilo and her son John took the podium and announced the establishment of a scholarship in memory of Frank Hnilo, one of the co-founders of DiGiovine, Hnilo, Jordan and Johnson accounting firm and an ardent supporter of education.</p>

	<p>Norma said, &ldquo;The Education Center as been a big help, if not a life-saving one, for many young people.  Dr. Litow and his staff demonstrate a deep concern for those who are placed in their care. They are straightforward, know how to communicate, and place the responsibility of one's future back on to the laps of those who come to the center for help.&rdquo; </p>
 
	<p>She added, &ldquo;This is a special night for us. We are reminded of a night like this not to many years ago, when Frank was recognized as the 2010 Business Partner award winner, saluting his personal dedication to volunteerism. It was an honor he valued very much. Our family chose The Education Center as a place for tribute gifts to be given in Frank's memory because it is an important local charitable organization, and he always had a fondness for assisting in life's education of young people. Frank hoped to have a scholarship fund set up in his name. It is with great pleasure that we formally establish the Frank Hnilo Scholarship Fund, to help students receive the same care that we have felt as a family.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Later in the evening, Dr. Michael Litow, founder of The Education Center, told attendees about one of his students who had recently suffered a significant injury and announced a scholarship in his honor. The student, Chris Sahm, is a junior at Neuqua Valley High School. Litow described Chris as a kind, caring, great all-around kid, a hard-working student and athlete. &ldquo;He exemplifies what The Education Center is all about &ndash; empowering young people to take ownership and responsibility for their own lives. He is persistent, a battler, a very determined young man.&rdquo; Litow explained, &ldquo;He has a difficult journey ahead of him with physical and occupational therapy, but he does not give up. He is an inspiration to me and to others who meet him.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Chris&acute;s father, Bill Sahm, later explained that his son was a normal teenager who loved cross-country and videogames until he awoke with a severe headache and massive brain hemorrhage on June 10. &ldquo;Chris is always positive, working with doctors and doing what they ask. He is steadily recovering, and we are hopeful about his future. His attitude has been fantastic!&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Part of the proceeds of The Education Center&acute;s Kids&acute; Best Friend Benefit will help fund these three scholarships. The scholarships will be awarded to students who are currently enrolled at The Education Center and to former students who are attending college.</p>

	<p>The Education Center, located in Naperville, is a nationally recognized children&acute;s organization that for more than 30 years has been helping kids succeed in school and in life. With a 97 percent success rate of graduating students who need help facing obstacles that may include a learning disability, traumatic life event, or other serious issue, The Education Center offers area families a place of hope and help.</p> 

<strong><p>For more information about The Education Center, please contact Dr. Michael Litow at 630-420-7807.  The Education Center is located at 113 East Van Buren in Naperville.</p></strong>

	<img src="/images/Dawn-Newman-2013-Kids-Best-Friend-Award.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; width: 250px;">
    <p>For many years, Dawn Newman has dedicated countless hours to helping kids in Naperville and around the world, both professionally and as a volunteer.</p> 

	<p>She is beginning her sixth year as a member of the Naperville Education Foundation&acute;s (NEF&acute;s) Board of Trustees and is currently serving as chair. Newman has been involved in all aspects of NEF during her years of service. She was instrumental in developing the foundation&acute;s new Governance Committee, chairing and supporting fundraisers, and increasing NEF&acute;s visibility through her dynamic public speaking and networking skills. She also served on the Ellsworth Home and School Board for seven years, including one year as its president.</p>

	<p>One day each year, she works with Naperville North High School students at her office, teaching them math and scaling skills. The students learn to design dog houses to scale. The kids are quite creative with their designs, and Newman Architecture recently earned an Outstanding Partner Award from Naperville North High School for this annual program.</p>

	<p>In 2004, Newman was awarded the State Board of Education&acute;s &quot;Those Who Excel Award.&quot; The awards program annually honors people who have made outstanding contributions to public and nonpublic elementary and secondary education.</p>

	<p>As a former president and member of the Rotary Club of Naperville &ndash; Sunrise, Newman assisted with fundraising and provided technical support for a new school in Tikondane, Zambia. During the past year, Dawn and her husband, Mike Tenuta, hosted a Rotary International exchange student from Germany. She also served as vocation chair of the club, in which Rotary gave scholarships to students in Naperville and provided financial support and volunteers for the District 203 Mock Trial and Entrepreneurship Trade Show.</p>

	<p>Professionally, Newman is an interior designer who has served as the lead designer for many award-winning projects with Newman Architecture, always working to create better learning environments for students. Through her recommended uses of paint color and light, the architectural firm makes learning spaces interesting and stimulating to children so they want to attend school and learn. She has also provided support for Newman Architecture&acute;s leading role in Schools for Children of the World, in which they design and build schools in poor areas in numerous countries.</p>

	<p>&quot;For many years, Dawn has generously shared her time and talents to improve the education of children through the local schools and through her work as a principal in an architectural firm that designs schools in the United States and abroad,&quot; said Dr. Litow. &quot;We are happy to honor her and showcase her efforts so that others will be encouraged to also give of their time.&quot;</p>


<h2 style="background: #6c6c6c; color: white; padding: 6px; text-align: center; clear: both; margin-top: 1em;">Business Partner Award 
<br>Molex Incorporated</h2>

	<img src="/images/Graham-Brock-accepting-2013-Business-Partner-Award-for-Molex-Inc.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; width: 250px;">
	<p>Graham Brock, president, global sales and marketing, will accept the Business Partner Award on behalf of Molex Incorporated.  The award recognizes the support the company has provided by employing a student from The Education Center. </p>
	
    <p>&quot;We are honored to receive this award as it reflects our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive workplace,&quot; said Brock. &quot;We are extremely pleased to be able to support The Education Center in their endeavor to help students with disabilities gain valuable work experience.&quot;  Molex is a leading one-source supplier of interconnect products and is located in Lisle, Illinois.</p> 
	
    <p>According to Dr. Litow, &quot;Their employment of this young man goes beyond the invaluable opportunity afforded to him to gain work experience at Molex, both in the Customs Department and the Global Sales Division. His employment is a unique demonstration of corporate citizenship that not only makes a different in the life of the student but makes a difference in the lives of others who face societal struggles due to disabilities that create employment barriers. It gives hope for a brighter future to others like him.&quot;</p> 

	<p>Litow added, &quot;Their endorsement to hire this young man shows their understanding of and appreciation for the unique value each individual can bring to the work place when they focus on ability, not disability. We appreciate their openness to accept one of our young men who needed a helping hand to make the transition into employment. We know from experience that the Molex story will help other corporate partners be inspired to open their doors as well.&quot;</p>
