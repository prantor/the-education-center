The Center is a place full of warmth, passion and dedication. I think it comes across in interactions with students, parents and in the community. It's very satisfying work to sit down with a kid and help them to realize that where they're at in life is not the end of the world, and that there are a lot of great options and positive experiences waiting for them if they make the effort for themselves.

For the staff and myself, the feeling is indescribable when we witness a turn around in a student's life and hear a 'thank you' from a kid or their parents. There is a chance to make a difference in kids' lives, and that's why we founded the Center.
