"The Education Center has a unique approach to working with teens. It treats teens with respect while allowing them to explore their choices. At the same time, it uses a realistic approach when supporting their choices, whether they be positive or negative. The Education Center is in "it" for the long haul and will do whatever it takes to help a teen be successful, no matter how unconventional the process may be."

"The counselors and social workers at Neuqua Valley High School work collaboratively with Dr. Mike Litow and The Education Center to help some of our most difficult students. In fact, the students that Mike and his staff work with are those who often have a very long history of being unsuccessful academically. However, with Mike's coaching patience and unique approach, they begin to experience success - often for the first time. The staff at The Education Center welcomes those students and their families with open arms and helps them to leam to advocate for themselves. What is most impressive is that the students begin to take responsibility for their own learning, recognize their strengths, and build on them.'

Mike Litow’s vast wealth of knowledge regarding adolescents, his longevity in the field, and his unique ability to see great potential in young people who have been beset by adolescent troubles, assures me they are being placed in good hands.
