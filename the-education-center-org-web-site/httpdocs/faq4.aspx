Anybody can attend The Education Center. Parents have to initiate enrollment. Once we do the intake, we generally work for 10 weeks with a child one-on-one, once or twice a week, during evenings and weekends. We work with the young person's whole community - parents, teachers, religious leaders, employers and youth officers - to help each individual create a plan of success.
