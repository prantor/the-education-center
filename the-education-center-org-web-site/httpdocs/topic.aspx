<h2 style="padding-left: 15px;">Why might a student be underachieving?</h2>

One is considered to be underachieving when he or she is performing below his or her potential.  There are many reasons this might happen.<br /><br />
Students may just think getting good grades isn't cool.  More often though, there are other factors such as not getting enough sleep, poor nutrition, boredom, disruptive
family issues, overcoming trauma, ADD/ADHD, other learning disabilities, or trouble seeing or hearing clearly.  Underachievement can also be attributed to low self-esteem; a
student who has been told he/she is not smart enough may do poorly in school because he/she believes it.<br /><br />
There may be problems at school such as conflicts with teachers, negative peer pressure, an environment that is too challenging or not challenging enough, boring assignments,
or just a feeling that nobody cares.  A student may be struggling to understand the material.  Or a student may be struggling to develop organization skills and/or time management skills.
<br /><br />
Problems may also originate at home such as from conflicts between parents (including separation or divorce), over protectiveness of parents who won't let their kids explore their own interests,
over-empowerment of children who need structure and authority, over competitive parents who push their kids too much in school or other activities, neglect from a parent (possibly
due to some other more concerning problem), feelings of inadequacy due to comparisons with parents, siblings, or peers, physical, or emotional health problems, insufficient sleep, or poor nutrition.
