The Center's approach is one-on-one listening and sharing of advice. Above all, young people need a lot of support and attention, from both parents and teachers. Our approach to each child is different. Parents or teachers can't have just one set of rules or guidelines for dealing with kids. They need to be flexible, open-minded and creative.

I think parents need to turn off the television and get involved in their children's lives. The remote control switch can't instill values, confidence or educate; but parents can. School needs to feel more like a place where students aren't just passing through for eight hours a day. Kids should feel that school is the center of the community, and that they can express themselves freely, and not get lost in the shuffle.
