<p>Sometimes the behavioral problems are caused by an underlying psychological condition such as depression or drug dependency. In these cases we will refer a child through our network of therapists and treatment centers. Because they will need support in this endeavor, we often continue our sessions advising them to be direct and honest with their therapists and helping them become responsible for their behavior. Once they can begin to control their behavior, they can make better decisions and choices, which makes their involvement with the Center all the more meaningful.</p>
<p>If you know someone from the ages of 4-20 experiencing difficulties in school and life, The Education Center can help.</p>
<p>Call The Education Center at (630) 420-7807 or email us, 24 hours a day to set up an appointment. Appointments are made for evenings and Saturdays.</p>
<p>Scholarships are available for students in need.</p>
