    <p>Our mission is to help children succeed in school as well as in life.  We discover what a child is good at and then build on their own interests.  Children and teens trust us because we blieve in them.</p>
    <p>Our close relationships with school systems and the business community in Chicago and its suburbs, allow us to advocate for our students with guidance counselors and teachers as well as to connect a child with a potential mentor or employer.  And we never turn away a child because of money.  Whatever it takes, we go the distance for our kids.</p>
