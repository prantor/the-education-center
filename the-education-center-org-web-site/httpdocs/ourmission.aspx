<p style="font-size: 10pt;">The Education Center of Developmental Resources is a counseling and referral center that provides a nontraditional form of counseling — life coaching — that helps children and teens gain self-confidence, independence and skills to last a lifetime. Through an individualized step-by-step approach of listening and mentoring, our participants overcome negative situations and influences, get on the right track in school and gain the self-esteem vital to realizing their dreams.
