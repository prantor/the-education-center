<b>Solving Violence in Our Communities:<br>
A Common Sense Approach
</b></p>
<p>
In the wake of the tragedy in Colorado, and since 1995 responses to violence in high schools in California, Alaska, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas and Kentucky, many people are asking why and how could such a thing happen.
</p>
<p>
We have been quick to provide the opinions of numerous experts and this same discussion has occurred far too long.  There is now a predictable litany of “if onlys.”  If only these few bad kids were kicked out.  If only parents would be responsible.  If only schools had the right discipline policy.  If only we had more of the right kind of staff.  IF only we had the right surveillance devices.  If only we had really practiced zero tolerance.  If only kids couldn’t surf the Internet.  If only video games weren’t so violent.  And so on.  And when the litany of “if onlys” is completed, the blame begins.
</p>
<p>
We appear to believe that these episodes of violence and their perpetrators are to be managed.  And, if “managed correctly” with a new policy, a new law, a new piece of surveillance equipment, the episodes of violence will diminish.  In short, we want strongly to believe that we either can control enough factors in the environment or that we can “fix” the students who end up committing these heinous acts.  And we adults would, of course, like to do all this by the kind of “remote control” of writing new sentences in the policy handbook, monitoring behavior, and so on.
	</p>
<p>
If one child feels threatened, alone or disconnected, then all children are not safe.  Traditionally, what has worked in the past is not working now.  We must as parents, schools and communities find meaningful ways to connect to our youth. Therefore, we believe it is time to think outside the box.  To give up our notions of remote control.  To believe that children and adults should do, instead of being done to.
</p>
<p>	
We must do things WITH our young people so that we can hear them in a meaningful way.  They need to be actively involved as true partners in decisions that concern them.
	</p>
<p>
While fully appreciating high test scores, the natural student leaders and the peace and quiet created by conformist students, we need to fully engage not just the elite and the docile amount the student bodies, but ALL students – students of every achievement and behavior modality.  Using strategies addressing the while person – socially, emotionally and academically, and may we dare say, even spiritually – we can create environments for learning and growing in which every student can discover their real value and place in the world.  This is, to be sure, a challenging process, but by now we should have discovered that we cannot force-feed students a sense of worth, a feeling of belonging.  Those things come from real and sustained engagement.
</p>
<p>	
We believe we must give our young people the OPPORTUNITIES to assume responsibility, to become independent learners and leaders ready for the 21st century challenges.  There are schools where this approach has truly worked.  For example at </p>
<ul>
<li>Thornton Fractional Township-North, a suburban high school of mixed diversity in the South Chicago Metro area, there now exists a vision of shared leadership that now includes the students.  A teacher-student planning process has been started to create strategies to involve students more in the decision making at this school.
<li>Graham Taining Center, a Chicago public school for “cognitively disabled” students, student leaders and faculty have been trained in leadership skills.  The faculty’s new theme is “Whatever It Takes, As Long As It’s Unity.”  The student leaders recently presented to the entire school community ideas on making a better school, followed by a “town meeting” interactive forum.  It was inspiring to see students, event at this ability level, motivate faculty, students and parents.
<li>Thornton Township High School in Harvey, a powerful student vision was created by 60 potential student leaders and presented with their goals for school improvements to 250 faculty.  Their presentation changed the minds and hearts of many of the faculty regarding the role of students.
<li>Sullivan Specialty School in Chicago, elementary student leaders formed three teams with teacher advisors to help their fellow students:  Be My Buddy (help new students), Talk it Out (help peers with social/emotional challenges) and Tutoring (academics).
<li>Kelly High School in Chicago, school leaders have been working with Total Quality Management, a corporate concept, for years.  Recently, we asked the student council their ideas on “What can the student council do to help our school be more successful?”  Amazingly enough, their responses are right in line with the faculty’s and administration’s strategic direction.
</ul>
<p>
Our experience shows that if we address the complex problems faced by our nation’s schools – problems that periodically give rise to violence such as in Colorado – from a comprehensive point of view, we will begin making real progress.  A UNIFIED effort and vision, exemplified by the schools mentioned above, that continually adapts to student’s real needs, must be directed toward creating an environment of teacher, parent, administration, community and student partnership.
</p>
<p>	
We recommend providing learning experiences for all participants from the school and community, with students as the major stakeholders.  They’re voices that are rarely heard.  These experiences should be designated to educate the entire school community about the strength of diversity, the power of personal responsibility, and the benefits of living peacefully together.  These experiences should make clear that as long as one person in a community feels unsafe, then everyone in the community is at risk.
 </p>
<p>	
“Fixing” students does not work.  “Doing things to” or “doing things for” students does not work.  The kind of lasting change resulting in superior education and living peacefully together will emerge if we give the time and take the risk of beginning the process of inviting our young people to participate meaningfully in managing their education and their growing into adulthood as contributing citizens.  Together, we make a powerful force for positive growth in students.

Dr. Litow founded The Education Center in Oak Park in 1979 to provide counseling services for young people ages 4 to 20 who could not afford standard fees.  A second Center was opened in Naperville in 1987.  Over the years, the staff has worked with thousands of young people and families on issues such as learning disabilities, physical and sexual abuse, drugs and gangs, unemployment, truancy and running away, homelessness and suicide.  Here, at-risk students receive the extra-special attention for their needs that is usually hard to come by in a school setting.  For more information on the Center call 630.420.7807.
