We utilize resources in the community. Anyone can help, from business people to athletes and politicians. Anyone willing to take the time to talk to children can be trained to be a mentor. Many professionals I've met with over the years had to overcome great adversity to arrive at success. These people don't lecture kids, but they show them by example.
<br /><br />
We're always looking for new mentors for kids, from all levels of society with all different types of backgrounds and experiences. Just as kids are all uniquely valuable and talented so too are all mentors. The Center provides training and orientation to make sure a good match is created, and monitors mentorship participants closely. Working together, mentoring is mutually rewarding!
